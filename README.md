This project researches employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. The data came from saved CSV files and I performed data modeling, engineering, analysis via SQL.

In doing analysis, I looked at employees, their accompanying employee numbers and hire dates. I also took a look at salaries and the sex of the employees. The data consists of a little more than 300,000 total employees.
I parsed out data to take a look at people who were specifically hired in 1986.
For all years of the data, which ranged from 1985 - 2000, I listed out departments and managers of the departments. 
The salary range was from $40,000 to about $129,000.

Further analysis uncovered interesting facts like how many employees had specific unique names and frequency of names as well.
